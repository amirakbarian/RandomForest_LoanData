# RandomForest_LoanData

The data is from LendingClub.com  and it is available in CSV format. 
LendinClub is a platform which connects money borrowers with investors.

First I made some visualizations to better understand the data and the features.

After that I split the data into traing and testing data set and fit the RandomForest model from SciKit-Learn on the data.
